# Employee TeamGenerator10

AS A management level employer, I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic information in a simple database.
This would give quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

Mock-Up/Demo Image:

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input, the data base generates the HTML file, that displays a clear formatted team roster based on user input
By Clicking the Email source, then my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
Once I click on the GitHub usernameTHEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application, THEN I am prompted to enter the team managerâ€™s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern and other users or to finish building my team

THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated for final results.
